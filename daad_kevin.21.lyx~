The candidate, Kevin Speyer, holds years of experience performing research
 in polymer physics and Soft Matter by computer simulations.
 He published two papers in international peer-reviewed journals.
 His main working subjects are Polymer Brushes, composed of semiflexible
 chains anchored to the walls of a nano-channel, and the interactions between
 this soft substrate and liquid flow in nano-fluidic systems.
 A wide range of physical quantities are measured in these systems, from
 the molecular degrees of freedom to thermodynamic or rheological properties.
 The work is performed by means of Molecular Dynamics simulations, in the
 context of Statistical Mechanics theory.
 The applicant hold PhD CONICET scholarship working in the Theory and Simulation
 of Soft Matter Group of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CAC-CNEA)
 in Argentina.
 The group has a history of collaboration with the Soft Matter Theory Group
 of Prof.
 Dr.
 Marcus Müller in Göttingen.

In his Diploma Thesis (MS equivalent), entitled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Simulation of simple liquids confined in soft channels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the candidate studied a nanochannel with confining surfaces coated with
 grafted polymers.
 In this work, the interaction between the liquid and the grafted polymers
 was analyzed in equilibrium and in flow conditions.
 This first study was focused on the influence of the bending rigidity of
 the semiflexible polymers on the static and dynamical properties of the
 system.
 The interaction between the soft substrate and the liquid is hydrophobic,
 giving rise to a Cassie–Baxter state.
 Equilibrium properties such as brush height and bending energy were measured,
 varying the grafting density (number of chains per surface area) and the
 stiffness of the polymers.
 The characteristics of the brush–liquid interface and the morphology of
 the polymer chains supporting the liquid were studied for different bending
 rigidities.
 Non-equilibrium simulations were performed, moving the walls of the channel
 in opposite directions at constant speed, obtaining a Couette velocity
 profile in the bulk liquid.
 The molecular degrees of freedom of the polymers are studied as a function
 of the shear rate.
 The violation of the no-slip boundary condition and the slip properties
 were analyzed as a function of the shear rate, grafting density and bending
 stiffness.
 At high grafting densities, a finite slip length independent of the shear
 rate or bending constant was found, while at low grafting densities a very
 interesting non-monotonic dependence on the bending constant is observed.
 This work was published in the journal

In another study, the candidate analyzed a system composed of a liquid droplet
 in a nanochannel, coated with semiflexible hydrophobic polymers by means
 of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.
 The studied system is then a moving droplet in a slit-like channel, coexisting
 with its vapor phase.
 The polymer chains, grafted by the terminal bead to the confining walls,
 are described by a coarse-grained model that accounts for chain connectivity,
 excluded volume interactions and local chain stiffness.
 The rheological, frictional and dynamical properties of the brush are explored
 over a wide range of persistence lengths.
 A rich behavior of polymer conformations and concomitant changes in the
 friction properties are found over the wide range of studied polymer stiffnesse
s.
 A rapid decrease in the droplet velocity was observed as the rigidity of
 the chains is increased for polymers whose persistence length is smaller
 than their contour length.
 A strong relation between the internal dynamics of the brush and the droplet
 transport properties is found, which could be used to tailor flow properties
 by surface functionalization.
 The monomers of the brush layer, under the droplet, present a collective
 “treadmill belt” like dynamics which can only be present due the existence
 of grafted chains.
 The changes in spatial extension upon variations of polymer stiffness are
 described, with bidimensional velocity and density profiles.
 The deformation of the polymer brushes due to the presence of the droplet
 is analyzed in detail.
 Lastly, the droplet−gas interaction is studied by varying the liquid to
 gas ratio, observing a speed increase for droplets that flow close to each
 other, compared to a train of droplets that present a large gap between
 consecutive droplets.
 These results were recently published in

Working Project
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Using large-scale computer simulation of coarse-grained polymer models we
 propose the study of non-equilibrium behavior of active polymer brushes.
 This soft-matter system mimics active biological systems capable of directed
 transport.
 The system also exhibits an intricate, non-equilibrium single-chain dynamics
 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tumbling motion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), and our simulation study will elucidate to what extent the individual
 molecular motions are coupled and synchronized (spatiotemporal correlations)
 and how the molecular motion interacts and dictates the collective structure
 and flow field.
 The project takes advantage also of the strong experience of the applicant
 in semi-flexible polymer brushes, by adding the important element of chain
 activeness.
 A given energy per unit time will be injected in each grafted polymer to
 obtain a self-sustained oscillation of the polymers, which will give raise
 to a collective behavior depending on chain-stifness, grafting density
 and the properties of the liquid.
 The student will have the opportunity to learn about modern concepts of
 non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and state-of-the-art simulation technique
s on clusters of CPUs and GPUs.

Goals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Polymers in flow have attracted abiding interest by experimental and theoretical
 researchers.
 By irreversibly grafting a polymer onto a solid substrate one fabricates
 brush coatings that are both, mechanically stable as well as versatile
 for tuning the wettability and friction of the coated surface.

 In our previous collaboration we have developed and utilized coarse-grained
 computer simulations to study polymer brushes under flow,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and studied the tumbling motion of the individual grafted macromolecules
 and the concomitant reversal of the near-surface flow under shear.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We propose now to extend our study to collective phenomena in active polymer
 brushes, which exhibit collective, non-equilibrium phenomena.

The coating of the surfaces with tethered polymers alters the flow properties
 in the ultimate vicinity of the coated surface.
 These boundary effects become particular important in microfluidic devices
 that manipulate confined liquids at the pico-liter scale, electroosmotic
 flow, or vascular biological systems.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 Much interest has focused on driving the liquid motion externally, e.g.,
 by a pressure difference, shear of confining boundaries, or an electric
 field.
 Such conditions are particularly relevant for applications such as lab-on-chip
 devices,

\begin_layout Standard
Active particles and polymers in biological context or active, synthetic
 realizations constitute an alternative driving mechanism that has attracted
 much attention recently.
 In these systems, the active entities possess internal degrees of freedom
 that enable them to take energy from the environment and perform mechanical
 work in the form of, e.g., systematic movements.
 Active systems under study range from bacteria

 such as cilia, flagella and molecular motors.

 These last cases include also so-called micro-swimmers of biological origin,

 nano-particles.

 and the collective states of these active materials is of great current
 interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinated motion of cilia, which are comprised of active, semiflexible
 filaments anchored to a surface, can give rise to directed motion of micro-orga
nisms in nature or to pumping of fluids in certain tissues.
 For example, cilia in the human respiratory tract pump viscous fluids away
 from the lungs or propel dust particles out of the body.
 This amazing function and the efficiency of cilia transport has stimulated
 research groups to design synthetic analogues in order to regulate flow
 or particle motion in microfluidic devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We propose to study planar nano-channels coated by active polymers, end-grafted
 to the confining walls of a narrow slit channel.
 The system is a generalization of semi-flexible polymer brushes, which
 have been previously studied thoroughly by the applicant.
 For this project we add a protocol energy injection which gives raise to
 self-sustained movement.

 presents preliminary examples of these systems.
 We have already developed a coarse-grained beating model for the individual
 chains that captures the essential features of the movement of typical
 active filaments, such as cilia or flagellae.
 A cilium filament, for example, presents a power stroke and a recovery
 stroke.
 In the former the cilium stretches out and moves rather fast in one direction.
 In the recovery stroke, in turn, the cilium bends and slowly retracts.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Elgeti_15"

\end_inset

 We reproduced this asymmetric beating pattern with our coarse-grained model.
 This motion results from an internal activity or is driven by coupling
 to an external, time-dependent field.
 A deep characterization of this model must be done in dry brushes, to study
 then the liquid transport due to the collective motion of active grafted
 polymers.
 Specifically, we propose two types of couplings between self-sustained
 polymer chains.
 The first one is given by the direct interaction between neighboring chains
 and the second one is an harmoning coupling of neighboring chains close
 to the grafting point.

Methachronal waves are frequently observed in biological cilia, i.e., there
 are regions of perfect synchronization surrounded by disordered beating
 patterns.
 We want to address also the origin of these collective features and the

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained
 bead-spring models.
 The active polymer brushes are described by the Kremer-Grest model, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Grest_86,Kremer_90"

\end_inset

 where segments interact via a Lennard-Jones potential describing the harsh
 excluded volume of individual segments.
 A Finite Non-linear Extensively Elastic (FENE) potential accounts for the
 chain connectivity.
 We have used this model in our previous joint work on polymer brushes.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Pastorino_06,Pastorino_09,Pastorino_14"

\end_inset

 Additionally, we apply a harmonic bending potential between two consecutive
 bonds that connect a given monomer with its two nearest neighbors in order
 to tune the rigidity of the semi-flexible polymer chain.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Speyer_15"

\end_inset

.
 The applicant has an important experience in the study of semi-flexible
 brushes under flow and has implemented the bending rigidity of the polymer
 chains.
 Importantly the combination of harsh excluded-volume interactions between
 segments and a maximal bond length guarantees that chain contours cannot
 cross through each other in the course of the simulation.
 These entanglement effects that dramatically alter the dynamics in dense
 melts of long polymers, may be important for the synchronization of the
 active polymers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are planning the use of molecular dynamics simulation with a DPD (or
 Lowe-Anderson) thermostat.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "DPD1,Lowe"

\end_inset

 This pairwise thermostat obeys translation invariance and locally conserves
 momentum, thereby duly accounting for hydrodynamic interactions that are
 mediated via the explicit solvent.

 code that is well suited for computer clusters, but the applicant will
 learn the use and programing of a GPU-program that is based on the HOOMD

An explicit solvent will be added to channel coated by active brushes, described

 concomitant hydrodynamic interactions, taking advantage of the experience
 of the German group.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Liquid flow with synchronized chain dynamics

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Imposing coordinated movement to the chains, mimicking typical cilia dynamics,
 we will study the flow generated in the solvent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Upper and lower active brush layers of the slit channel will be studied
 as a function of polymer beating frequency, amplitude, and direction.
 Directed flow in the vicinity of the individual active brush layers can
 be achieved by choosing parameters that result in synchronization (obtained
 in the previous task using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

), or by imposing a phase-locked dynamics with a time-dependent external
 force.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Special interesting cases are in-phase movement of active upper and lower
 brushes and anti-phase movement of upper and lower grafted layers.
 If the polymers drive locally the fluid, the in-phase movement is expected
 to produce a plug flow, whereas the anti-phase movement results in shear
 flow.

  title = {Brushes of semiflexible polymers in equilibrium and under flow in
	a super-hydrophobic regime},

  abstract = {We performed molecular dynamics simulations to study the equilibrium
	and flow properties of a liquid in a nano-channel with confining
	surfaces coated with a layer of grafted semiflexible polymers. The
	coverage spans a wide range of grafting densities from essentially
	isolated chains to dense brushes. The end-grafted polymers were described
	by a bead spring model with a harmonic potential to include the bond
	stiffness of the chains. We varied the rigidity of the chains{,}
	from fully flexible polymers to rigid rods{,} in which the configurational
	entropy of the chains is negligible. The brush-liquid interaction
	was tuned to obtain a super-hydrophobic channel{,} in which the liquid
	did not penetrate the polymer brush{,} giving rise to a Cassie-Baxter
	state. Equilibrium properties such as brush height and bending energy
	were measured{,} varying the grafting density and the stiffness of
	the polymers. We also studied the characteristics of the brush-liquid
	interface and the morphology of the polymer chains supporting the
	liquid for different bending rigidities. Non-equilibrium simulations
	were performed{,} moving the walls of the channel in opposite directions
	at constant speed{,} obtaining a Couette velocity profile in the
	bulk liquid. The molecular degrees of freedom of the polymers were
	studied as a function of the Weissenberg number. Also{,} the violation
	of the no-slip boundary condition and the slip properties were analyzed
	as a function of the shear rate{,} grafting density and bending stiffness.
	At high grafting densities{,} a finite slip length independent of
	the shear rate or bending constant was found{,} while at low grafting
	densities a very interesting non-monotonic dependence on the bending
	constant is observed.},
